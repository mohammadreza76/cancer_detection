# About Dataset(information from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data):

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant





# About Project:
In this we want to detect breast cancer.I used 2 algorithms.First i used svm model and then logistic regression.in logistic regression,one time with feature selection and the other with out feature selection.

In svm model i used rbf kernel and i got 97.2% accuracy.In Logistic Regression model with out feature selection i got 97.9% accuracy and with feature selection i got 96.5% accuracy but in Logistic Regression model with feature selection we reduce features to 14 so we reduce the processing and that is good thing and also i used confusion matrix for all algorithms and  Logistic Regression model with out feature selection that was the best algorithms in confusion matrix.
